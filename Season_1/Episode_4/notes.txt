THere are 2 types of Patterns : 
1) Common JS Module (cjs)
2) ES Modules (mjs)

Common JS Module (MJS or CJS) : 
module.exports 
require()
by default used in nodeJS 
Older Way 
Synchronous Ways 
Code Run in Non Strict Mode 


ES Modules (ESM):
import export 
by default used in React , Angular 
Newer Way 
We have option of doing in Asynchronous way (THis is way more powerful) by default its synchronous .
Strict Mode is by default 

But Commite is saying that going forward ES Module will be the standard way to write the code 
But for Now Maximum CodeBases is using the CommonJS Module right now . 
So in this course we will be using Common JS Mpdule going forward .
