NodeJS - JS on Server 
Server : Remote Computer , located at CPU 
What is means when you are running website on server . 

There are 2 things : Server , Client 
Client : Your PC 
Lets say you do www.google.com : it will have an IP (114.265.123.8) and this IP will be map to computer 

So Earlier JavaScript used to run on the Client Server and after coming NodeJS javascript started runnning on Server . 
So For Frontend + Backend we can use JavaScript . So Single Developer knowing JavaScript can work on FullStack . 
Frameworks like MERN , MEAN become popular just because javascript can run on client and servers .


NodeJS is C++ Code ? 
JS Engine - V8(Google) is C++ Program . 
https://github.com/v8/v8 : 72% of code is written in C++ . 
V8 Engine - execute JS Code , is google's open source high performance javascript and web assembly engine, written in C++ . V8 can be embedded into any C++ Application .
JavaScript -> V8 -> Machine Level Code 

NodeJS is a C++ Application with V8 Embedded into it .

What is ECMAScript ? 
ECMAScript is a standard for scripting language like JavaScript. basically it defines rules like syntax and code . 
ECMAScript : 
Standards / Rules 
JS Engines have to follow these standards , Why ? 
So that all the engines will give same result of javascript code . 
V8 - Google 
Spider Monkey - Firefox 
Chakra - Microsoft
JavaScriptCore - Safari 

NodeJS -> V8 Engines + More SuperPower(API's on Server)

V8 engines has to follow this ECMA standards. and node.js has v8
engines, but node.js also has some superpowers, such as api calls on servers,
which make it more powerful than v8 engines alone, which cannot do
database connections, api calls, etc. because of ECMA standards. and this is
known as the JS runtime.

NodeJS -> 62% Javascript + 20% C++ so its more written in JavaScript


V8 is C++ Code Why ? 
Computer understands -> Binary Codes 
On Top of Binary Codes -> Assembly COde
On TOp of Assembly COde -> Machine Code 
On Top of Machine Code -> high Level Language (THis is we understand)

User writes in JS -> Its passed to C++ Engine -> Converted to Machine Code -> Binary Codes
